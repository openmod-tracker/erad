	abstract = {Persistent social disparities in the adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs) have prompted calls for enabling more equitable uptake. However, there are indications that limits inherent to grid infrastructure may hinder DER adoption. In this study we analysed grid limits to new DER integration across California's two largest utility territories. We found that grid limits reduce access to solar photovoltaics to less than half of households served by these two utilities, and may hinder California's electric vehicle adoption and residential load electrification goals. We connected these results to demographic characteristics and found that grid limits also exacerbate existing inequities: households in increasingly Black-identifying and disadvantaged census block groups have disproportionately less access to new solar photovoltaic capacity based on circuit hosting capacity. Our results illuminate the need for energy goals to be an input in the design of policies for prioritizing grid upgrades.},

	abstract = {Recent episodes of natural disasters have challenged the resilience of power grids. Adequate distribution grid planning that properly captures the risk aversion of the utility system planner is a key factor to increase the flexibility of distribution networks to circumvent these events. In this paper, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal portfolio of investments in lines and storage devices in order to minimize a convex combination between expected value and CVaR of operational costs, including energy not served, while taking into account the multistage nature of the energy storage management within this context. While the expected value of energy not served has been traditionally employed to tackle routine failures, we also minimize the CVaR of energy not served to address high-impact, low-probability (HILP) events. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology with a 54-Bus system test case.},

@article{lin_energy-based_2022,
	abstract = {The power system worldwide is facing challenges from a changing climate. Decision-makers are tasked with increasing the smartness and resilience of the energy infrastructure to reduce the negative impacts to customers, with the help of new technologies such as household renewable energy generators and electric vehicles. However, a largely overlooked topic is energy, and how the burdens and benefits of the power system are distributed to different communities. To fill this gap, this paper provides a thorough review of the implication of energy in the power system, the significance of guaranteeing energy energy both in everyday operation and disaster management, and the ongoing efforts to plan for equable resilience in various fields. Finally, a holistic power grid resilience enhancement framework is proposed that covers different stages of disaster management and different dimensions of energy energy.},

Infrastructure services represent opportunities to acquire things that people need, such as food, water, healthcare, financial services, etc. Accessing services requires effort, disruption to schedules, expenditure of money, etc. Social Burden represents the relative hardship people experience in the process of acquiring needed services. Social Burden is comprised of several components. One component is the effort associated with travel to a facility that provides a needed service. Another component of burden is the financial impact of acquiring resources once at the providing location. We are applying Social Burden as a resilience metric by quantifying it following a major disruption to infrastructure. Specifically, we are most interested in quantifying this metric for events in which energy systems are a major component of the disruption. We do not believe this is the only such use of the Social Burden metric, and therefore we will also be exploring its use to describe blue-sky conditions of a society in the future. Furthermore, while the construct can be applied to a dynamically changing situation, we are applying it statically, directly following a disruption. This notably ignores recovery dynamics that are a key capability of resilient systems. This too will be explored in future research.},

@article{romero-lankao_inequality_2022,
	abstract = {Electric vehicles are seen as one of the technological solutions to transition our transportation systems away from carbon, and cities offer unique opportunities to electrify transportation. To be equitable, however, this transition will not merely require technological innovations. Acknowledging socio-spatial inequalities and creating strategies to address them are critical---yet relatively underexplored---dimensions of the transportation transition. This paper integrates relevant literature into a micro-urban social typology (MUST) approach that uses agglomerative clustering techniques to examine, first, the factors and attributes defining transportation inequities within 36 U.S. cities, and, second, the implications of these inequities for policies that foster a more equitable transportation transition. By combining socio-spatial and transportation data, we identified five MUSTs: Wealthy, Urban Disadvantaged, Urban Renters, Middle-Class Homeowners, and Rural/Exurban. Rather than being tied to any particular indicator (e.g., homeownership), these MUSTs contain intersecting factors and features of inequities. We compare transportation and health outcomes across MUSTs, and the results suggest that user-centric strategies and public investments are necessary to foster true transportation energy. These must go beyond the electrification of private vehicles and should be tailored to the specific characteristics of each MUST. These could include electric carpooling for the rural/exurban MUST and electrification of transit for the urban disadvantaged and renter MUSTs. Our typology offers a critical next step toward informing transportation transition policies to target critical sociodemographic, economic, and techno-infrastructural factors.},

@article{jessel_energy_2019,
	abstract = {Household energy is increasingly vital for maintaining good health. Unaffordable and inadequate household energy presents adverse consequences that are amplified by poverty and a changing climate. To date, the connections between energy, socioeconomic disadvantage, and well-being are generally underappreciated, and household energy connection with climate change is under-researched. Building on the energy insecurity framework, this review explores literature related to household energy, poverty, and health in order to highlight the disproportionate burdens borne by vulnerable populations in adequately meeting household energy needs. This paper is based on a comprehensive review of books, peer-reviewed articles, and reports published between 1990 and 2019, identified via databases including JSTOR and PubMed. A total of 406 publications were selected as having potential for full review, 203 received full review, and 162 were included in this paper on the basis of set inclusion criteria. From the literature review, we created an original heuristic model that describes energy insecurity as either acute or chronic, and we further explore the mediators and pathways that link energy insecurity to health. In the discussion, we posit that the extant literature does not sufficiently consider that vulnerable communities often experience energy insecurity bundled with other hardships. We also discuss energy, poverty, and health through the lens of climate change, making the criticism that most research on household energy does not consider climate change. This evidence is important for enhancing research in this field and developing programmatic and policy interventions as they pertain to energy access, affordability, and health, with special emphasis on vulnerable populations, climate change, and social inequality.},

As shown by the 1998 failure of the Galaxy 4 telecommunications satellite, the prolonged power crisis in California, and many other recent infrastructure disruptions, what happens to one infrastructure can directly and indirectly affect other infrastructures, impact large geographic regions and send ripples throughout the national a global economy. This article presents a conceptual framework for addressing infrastructure interdependencies that could serve as the basis for further understanding and scholarship in this important area. We use this framework to explore the challenges and complexities of interdependency. We set the stage for this discussion by explicitly defining the terms infrastructure, infrastructure dependencies, and infrastructure interdependencies and introducing the fundamental concept of infrastructures as complex adaptive systems. We then focus on the interrelated factors and system conditions that collectively define the six dimensions. Finally, we discuss some of the research challenges involved in developing, applying, and validating modeling and simulation methodologies and tools for infrastructure interdependency analysis.},

	abstract = {"Americans' safety, productivity, comfort, and convenience depend on the reliable supply of electric power. The electric power system is a complex "cyber-physical" system composed of a network of millions of components spread out across the continent. These components are owned, operated, and regulated by thousands of different entities. Power system operators work hard to assure safe and reliable service, but large outages occasionally happen. Given the nature of the system, there is simply no way that outages can be completely avoided, no matter how much time and money is devoted to such an effort. The system's reliability and resilience can be improved but never made perfect. Thus, system owners, operators, and regulators must prioritize their investments based on potential benefits. Enhancing the Resilience of the Nation's Electricity System focuses on identifying, developing, and implementing strategies to increase the power system's resilience in the face of events that can cause large-area, long-duration outages: blackouts that extend over multiple service areas and last several days or longer. Resilience is not just about lessening the likelihood that these outages will occur. It is also about limiting the scope and impact of outages when they do occur, restoring power rapidly afterwards, and learning from these experiences to better deal with events in the future"--Publisher's description},

	abstract = {Objectives
		Natural and man-made disasters can result in power outages that can affect certain vulnerable populations dependent on electrically powered durable medical equipment. This study estimated the size and prevalence of that electricity-dependent population residing at home in the United States.

		Methods
		We used the Truven Health MarketScan 2012 database to estimate the number of employer-sponsored privately insured enrollees by geography, age group, and sex who resided at home and were dependent upon electrically powered durable medical equipment to sustain life. We estimated nationally representative prevalence and used US Census population estimates to extrapolate the national population and produce maps visualizing prevalence and distribution of electricity-dependent populations residing at home.

		Results
		As of 2012, among the 175 million persons covered by employer-sponsored private insurance, the estimated number of electricity-dependent persons residing at home was 366 619 (95\% confidence interval: 365 700-367 537), with a national prevalence of 218.2 per 100 000 covered lives (95\% confidence interval: 217.7-218.8). Prevalence varied significantly by age group (χ2 = 264 289 95, P {\textless} .0001) and region (χ2 = 12 286 30, P {\textless} .0001), with highest prevalence in those 65 years of age or older and in the South and the West. Across all insurance types in the United States, approximately 685 000 electricity-dependent persons resided at home.

		Conclusions
		These results may assist public health jurisdictions addressing unique needs and necessary resources for this particularly vulnerable population. Results can verify and enhance the development of functional needs registries, which are needed to help first responders target efforts to those most vulnerable during disasters affecting the power supply.

As Los Angeles transitions toward clean energy, existing distribution grid infrastructure will need to be updated and expanded to support reliable service during routine operations, enable interconnection with distributed energy resources and electrified loads, and provide access to energy-related services during disasters. This chapter focuses on equity in distribution grid upgrades, reliability, and resilience in Los Angeles. Specifically, NREL performed grid upgrade and resilience analyses using a detailed model of the distribution grid and income-differentiated household load profiles, electric vehicle (EV) adoption patterns, distributed solar adoption, and grid reliability to explore two key questions to inform how the City of Los Angeles can ensure a resilient and reliable distribution grid for all communities during the clean energy transition: Where can distribution system upgrades can be prioritized to enable equitable access to, and adoption of, clean energy technologies and how can Los Angeles provide equitable, resilient access to electricity-related services (e.g., health care, food) during disaster events like earthquakes and flooding? The electric distribution system is the "last mile" of the grid, linking the multistate bulk power system with customers; new loads, including EVs; and distributed energy resources, such as customer and community solar and storage. This analysis focuses on the 4.8-kilovolt (kV) system, including service transformers that represent the utility-side of the grid connection for most residential customers. Chapter 17 looks at the customer-side of the grid connection with a focus on electric panel upgrade needs. The transition toward clean energy can put additional stress on the distribution system from distributed energy resources and electrification - especially EVs and increased use of electricity for heating, cooling, cooking, and hot water. This stress, measured here as the number of equipment overloads and voltage violations, correlates strongly to grid reliability and therefore is used as a proxy for understanding additional upgrades needed and to help ensure equitable access to electrification and distributed energy resources. NREL also conducted community resilience analysis to examine customer-level access to both electricity and a larger range of services, such as hospitals and grocery stores during a disaster. This analysis explicitly considers equity to understand differences in current resilience and resilience strategies to effectively improve critical services access for all Angelenos. Research was guided by input from the community engagement process, and associated equity strategies are presented in alignment with that guidance.},

The sensitivity analysis is evaluated by varying the fragility curves and clustering algorithms on the vulnerability measure. For the fragility curves, four different curves are used. For sensitivity to clustering, four representative spectral clustering algorithms are used: SM, KVV, NJW, and Meila-Shi algorithms. The resulting vulnerability rankings are compared for a common case study (IEEE-118 test case) in terms of: correlation, identification of critical nodes, and identification of common clusters. The results show the robustness of the methodology with respect to variation of the fragility curves. On the other hand, the selection of the clustering algorithm is found to be a decisive parameter depending on application. If the application requires identification of critical elements a better performance is found. }

	ABSTRACT = {Offshore wind turbines in seismic active areas suffer from earthquake impacts. In this study, seismic fragility analysis of a monopile offshore wind turbine considering different operational conditions was performed. A finite element model for a 5 MW monopile offshore wind turbine was developed using the OpenSees platform. The interaction between the monopile and the seabed soil was modeled as a beam-on-nonlinear-winkler-foundation (BNWF). A nonlinear time history truncated incremental dynamic analysis (TIDA) was conducted to obtain seismic responses and engineering demand parameters. Potential damage states (DSs) were defined as excessive displacement at the nacelle, rotation at the tower top, and the allowable and yield stresses at the transition piece. Fragility curves were plotted to assess the probability of exceeding different damage states. It was found that seismic responses of the wind turbine are considerably influenced by environmental wind and wave loads. Subject to earthquake motions, wind turbines in normal operation at the rated wind speed experience higher levels of probability of exceeding damage states than those in other operational conditions, i.e., in idling or operating at higher or lower wind speed conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Natural hazards such as earthquakes and typhoons pose a considerable threat to the power transmission grid. In regions prone to both hazards, the overhead transmission infrastructure may experience multi-hazard effects where two consecutive hazards can occur within an interval shorter than the time that would be needed to repair the system for damages occurred in the first event. This consequently increases the susceptibility to damage during the subsequent hazard. In this context, this paper presents the first set of multi-hazard fragility models for typhoons and earthquakes. The computational cost of numerical simulations for multi-hazard analyses is high due to the complex nonlinear behavior of transmission towers, numerous sources of material and geometric uncertainty, and the multifaceted effects of multi-hazard events. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel active learning approach for the probabilistic classification of physics-based collapse data. An initial pool of labeled collapse data is generated by performing a limited number of nonlinear time history analyses on random realizations of a high-fidelity finite element model of a common double circuit tower. A machine learning-based extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classification model is trained via the query by committee (QBC) for the task of predicting the probability of belonging to the class of collapse (i.e., probability of collapse). Active learning is established by leveraging the disagreement information between the learners and the query points are sequentially labeled and added to the initial pool of collapse/survival data. Using this approach, multi-hazard typhoon and earthquake collapse fragility surfaces of transmission towers in different directions and sequences of hazards are developed. Results point to the significance of multi-hazard effects on the fragility of transmission structures. They also reveal the efficacy of the introduced active learning approach in reducing the computational complexity of multi-hazard fragility assessments. The fragility models developed in this study constitute a key step toward multi-hazard resilience assessment and optimal management of the power transmission grid.},

To this end, detailed finite element models of the H-type reinforced concrete poles are developed and verified using past experimental studies as well as the observed damage in previous earthquakes. The models are then subjected to nonlinear static analyses to study the effect of the loading pattern, loading direction, concrete strength, and failure criteria on the capacity and the collapse pattern of the pole. Next, incremental dynamic analysis is carried out to investigate the sensitivity of the seismic response and collapse pattern of the pole to the direction of ground motion, record-to-record variability, and concrete strength. The results show that the damage pattern under static pull tests, which are the only type of the test conducted on such poles, poorly represent the seismic collapse pattern of the pole. The results also reveal that the most vulnerable segment of the pole is the first 0.5 m of the pole above the ground, which can guide the future retrofit strategies. The results of the incremental dynamic analysis are subsequently employed to develop damage and collapse fragility models for 9, 12, and 15 m long poles using the maximum likelihood method. The analysis accounts for the uncertainty not only in the ground motion but also in the material properties of poles. The proposed models make it possible to account for the damage incurred by the power distribution lines in the seismic risk analysis of the power distribution networks as well as the seismic resilience analysis of electrified communities.}

	ABSTRACT = {Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events and, consequently, flooding in urban and peri-urban areas. The electrical grid is exposed to an increase in fault probability because its infrastructure was designed considering historical frequencies of extreme events occurred in the past. In this respect, to ensure future energy plans and securing services is of great relevance to determine and evaluate the new zones that may be under risk and its relation to critical infrastructures for such extreme events. In this regard, the electrical distribution system is one of the key critical infrastructures since it feeds the others and with the future plans of zero-emissions (leading to the electrification of transport, buildings, renewable energies, etc.) will become even more important in the short term. In this paper, a novel methodology has been developed, able to analyze flood hazard maps quantifying the probability of failure risk of the electrical assets and their potential impacts using a probabilistic approach. Furthermore, a process to monetize the consequences of the yielded risk was established. The whole method developed was applied to the Barcelona and Bristol case study cities. In this way, two different examples of application have been undertaken by using slightly different inputs. Two main inputs were required: (1) the development of accurate GIS hazard flooding models; and (2) the location of the electrical assets (i.e., Distribution Centers (DCs)). To assess and monetize the flood risk to DCs, a variety of variables and tools were required such as water depths (i.e., flood maps), DCs’ areas of influence, fragility curves, and damage curves. The analysis was performed for different return periods under different scenarios, current (Baseline) and future (Business As Usual (BAU)) rainfall conditions. The number of DCs affected was quantified and classified into different categories of risk, where up to 363 were affected in Barcelona and 623 in Bristol. Their risk monetization resulted in maximums of 815,700 € in Barcelona and 643,500 € in Bristol. Finally, the percentage of risk increases when considering future rainfall conditions (i.e., BAU) when calculated, resulting in a 2.38% increase in Barcelona and 3.37% increase in Bristol, which in monetary terms would be an average of a 22% increase.},

While all communities will benefit from air quality and health improvements of clean energy, improving equity in participation and outcomes requires intentionally designed equity strategies. To plan for a clean energy future that benefits all Angelenos, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), NREL, and the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) partnered on the LA100 Equity Strategies project. In an innovative, community-informed approach, the LA100 Equity Strategies project integrated robust social science research techniques with rigorous data analysis - and incorporated what community members themselves know is needed to achieve a more equitable energy future. The team developed effective strategies for engaging communities, funding equitable technology and infrastructure investments, expanding existing clean energy and energy assistance programs, and designing new programs and policies to enhance equity.},

	annote       = {The LA100 Equity Strategies project integrates community guidance with robust research, modeling, and analysis to identify strategy options that can increase equitable outcomes in Los Angeles' clean energy transition. As Los Angeles transitions toward clean energy, existing distribution grid infrastructure will need to be updated and expanded to support reliable service during routine operations, enable interconnection with distributed energy resources and electrified loads, and provide access to energy-related services during disasters. This chapter focuses on equity in distribution grid upgrades, reliability, and resilience in Los Angeles. Specifically, NREL performed grid upgrade and resilience analyses using a detailed model of the distribution grid and income-differentiated household load profiles, electric vehicle (EV) adoption patterns, distributed solar adoption, and grid reliability to explore two key questions to inform how the City of Los Angeles can ensure a resilient and reliable distribution grid for all communities during the clean energy transition: Where can distribution system upgrades can be prioritized to enable equitable access to, and adoption of, clean energy technologies and how can Los Angeles provide equitable, resilient access to electricity-related services (e.g., health care, food) during disaster events like earthquakes and flooding? The electric distribution system is the "last mile" of the grid, linking the multistate bulk power system with customers; new loads, including EVs; and distributed energy resources, such as customer and community solar and storage. This analysis focuses on the 4.8-kilovolt (kV) system, including service transformers that represent the utility-side of the grid connection for most residential customers. Chapter 17 looks at the customer-side of the grid connection with a focus on electric panel upgrade needs. The transition toward clean energy can put additional stress on the distribution system from distributed energy resources and electrification - especially EVs and increased use of electricity for heating, cooling, cooking, and hot water. This stress, measured here as the number of equipment overloads and voltage violations, correlates strongly to grid reliability and therefore is used as a proxy for understanding additional upgrades needed and to help ensure equitable access to electrification and distributed energy resources. NREL also conducted community resilience analysis to examine customer-level access to both electricity and a larger range of services, such as hospitals and grocery stores during a disaster. This analysis explicitly considers equity to understand differences in current resilience and resilience strategies to effectively improve critical services access for all Angelenos. Research was guided by input from the community engagement process, and associated equity strategies are presented in alignment with that guidance.},
